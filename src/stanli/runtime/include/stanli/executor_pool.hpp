// Interchangeable executors over one model, leased one evaluation at a
// time.
//
// An Executor cannot be shared between threads: it owns the value and
// adjoint arenas a sweep writes through, so two concurrent sweeps on one
// executor produce wrong numbers rather than a crash. A sampler running
// chains concurrently over ONE model handle still has to evaluate the
// same graph from several threads, so each caller borrows its own clone
// for the length of one evaluation and gives it back.
//
// The lease is scoped, not thread-owned. A thread_local executor would
// pin a clone for the life of every thread that ever touched the model
// and raise the question of what happens when the model outlives, or is
// outlived by, the threads holding its clones. Scoping it to the call
// answers both: the pool holds every clone, and a clone is either in the
// free list or in exactly one lease.
//
// The mutex is held only to move a pointer on and off the free list,
// never across an evaluation. That is uncontended next to a gradient on
// any model worth sampling; if a fast enough model ever proves otherwise
// the free list can go lock-free without changing this interface.
