// The adjoint of a register program, generated instead of replayed.
//
// An island's backward used to re-execute the whole program under
// stan::math::var: a vari allocated per operation, a virtual chain() per
// operation, and a nested tape torn down per call. That is bitwise-correct
// by construction -- it is the same var arithmetic CmdStan's generated code
// runs -- and it therefore costs what CmdStan costs, which is why the carver
// refused thirteen of the fourteen regions it could compile.
//
// This is the same derivative as a second pass over doubles. Reverse-mode
// source transformation over Program::Code, which is a closed set of about
// thirty-five opcodes:
//
//   forward   d = a * b
//   adjoint   t = adj[d]; adj[d] = 0;
//             adj[a] += val[b] * t; adj[b] += val[a] * t
//
// Every rule mirrors the corresponding stan-math rev implementation
// expression for expression -- operand grouping included, since the bar is
// bitwise agreement with the replay and not merely a correct derivative.
// tests/test_adjoint.cpp holds each opcode against the replay at fixed
// points, and STANLI_NO_NATIVE_ADJ=1 restores the replay at runtime, so the
// oracle is always one environment variable away.
//
// An adjoint instruction is its forward instruction read backwards, so it
// carries the same fields. What it adds is where to find VALUES: registers
// are mutable cells, and a register the forward overwrote no longer holds
// what the derivative needs. The generator finds those cases and has the
// forward save them into fresh checkpoint registers, which is the only
// analysis here that is not a table -- see gen_adjoint.
