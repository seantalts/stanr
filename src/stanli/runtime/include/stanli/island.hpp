// A tape island: one op standing in for a region of scalar code the graph
// is better off not holding as ops.
//
// Two things produce one. The carver (island.cpp) takes regions no pass
// could vectorize -- cross-lane recurrences: HMM forward algorithms,
// state-space updates -- and compiles them when that is measurably
// cheaper than the ops. Lowering produces the other kind: a region whose
// control flow depends on a parameter cannot become graph ops at all, so
// it is compiled out of MIR directly and the island is how it exists.
//
// The program itself is the shared register machine (program.hpp), so
// both kinds run the same way. Forward runs on plain doubles -- one
// dispatch where the region had thousands. Backward replays the program
// under stan-math nested autodiff and harvests the live-ins' adjoints:
// the same var arithmetic CmdStan's generated code runs for the same
// statements, so gradients match by construction. A branch on a parameter
// differentiates the taken branch, which is exactly what the generated
// C++ does, because it is the same autodiff seeing the same arithmetic.
//
// Registers are mutable cells, one per element of every slot the region
// touches; a len-k slot is k consecutive registers, so Eigen::Map works
// on ranges. Values come only from the forward double pass; the var pass
// exists for its adjoints.
//
// Densities appear only in propto-OFF form (the carver refuses propto):
// with no term-dropping, the forward is type-uniform and one templated
// call serves both passes. The backward does bind per mask, to skip the
// partials of data arguments, but propto term-dropping needs the same
// masks on the VALUE (see legacy_fns.cpp's dirichlet note) -- out of
// scope until islands absorb target terms.
