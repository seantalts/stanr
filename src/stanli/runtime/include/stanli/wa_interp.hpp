// Interpreted write_array: the fallback when the write_array graph cannot
// express the whole generate_quantities section.
//
// The graph is the fast path and stays it. It directly carries a first set of
// scalar-result RNG calls, including their caller-owned stream. What still
// defeats it is an unsupported or container-valued-result RNG, using an int
// draw as dynamic geometry/index/control flow, or a branch on a value computed
// during the draw (the HMM models' Viterbi recursions). A categorical draw's
// one probability-vector argument is graph-native. The remaining cases are
// exactly what a per-draw interpreter does naturally, and generated quantities
// run once per stored draw on plain doubles: the sampler's leapfrog path never
// goes through here.
//
// Per draw the host supplies the CONSTRAINED parameter values by name (the
// log_prob executor already computes them for its views); FnReadParam
// declarations are satisfied from that map instead of re-deriving the
// transforms, FnWriteParam appends to the CSV row, and RNG calls draw from
// the stream the caller passes in. Columns are discovered on the first
// evaluation and fixed from then on.
